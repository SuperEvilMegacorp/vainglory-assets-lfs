We try to categorize all issues, with easy to understand prefixes. Please prefix
your issue title with one of the following:

- Feature: Request for additional functionality, query parameters, etc.
- Player: Issues with data for the /players endpoint
- Match: Issues with data for the /matches endpoint
- Telemetry: Issues with data for telemetry

If you are requesting a change to data, all requests should include both current and
expected values.

Please report any times in UTC. 

Last, any general questions should be asked in our [Discord](https://discord.me/vaingloryapi).  Come on in and join the fun!

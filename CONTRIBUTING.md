## How to contribute to the Vainglory Game Data Service Documentation

### **Ooverview**
This repository captures Vainglory specific issues with the Gamelocker Platform.  Issues like
data format, data structure and data correctness are all within the scope of this board.

For platform related issues (those that affect every game title) including query parameters, endpoints, protocol issues, etc. please file a request in: https://github.com/gamelocker/platform

### **What to expect**

Any Issues filed here are reviewed by our team and handled as quickly as we can!

We will verify:
  * Clarity - The request must be described in detail and be understandable by someone not familiar with the game.  If you're concerned about a specific field, please include an example.
  * Examples - The request must include examples or in case of a Telemetry request propose a format.

If your request is accepted, we will sort your Issue by priority into the Github project board.
  
This board is used to organize as well as prioritize issues. Issues will be closed once the feature request or bug fix is rectified.

### **Do you have questions about to use that Game Data Service?**

## How to contribute to the Vainglory Game Data Service Documentation

### **What to expect**

Any issues filed here are reviewed by our team and handled as quickly as we can.

#### Data Requests

If the request is related to data being returned by the API, we will verify:
  * Clarity - The request must be described in detail and be understandable by someone not familiar with the game.
  * Examples - The request must include examples or in case of a Telemetry request propose a format.

If your request is accepted, we will close it add a link to it in either:
  * [#221](https://github.com/madglory/gamelocker-vainglory/issues/221) - Telemetry Requests
  * [#223](https://github.com/madglory/gamelocker-vainglory/issues/223) - /match Requests
  * [#224](https://github.com/madglory/gamelocker-vainglory/issues/224) - /player Requests

#### API Requests

Alternatively, if the request is related to the way the API works we will
review the ticket and, if accepted, assign accordingly.

### **Do you have questions about to use that Game Data Service?**

* Ask any question about how to use on the [Vainglory API Community Discord server](http://discord.me/vaingloryapi).

## How to contribute to the Vainglory Game Data Service Documentation

#### **What to expect**

Any issues filed here are reviewed by our team and handled as quickly as we can.

*Data Requests*
If the request is related to data being returned by the API, we will verify:
  * Clarity - Is the request easily understood by someone not familiar with the game.
    All requests must included a detailed description and may get assigne to new developerd.
  * Examples - Does the request include examples.  If it is telemetry related, did the
  requester suggest what the event should look like.  Etc.

If your request is accepted, we will close it add a link to it in either:
  * #221 - Telemetry Requests
  * #223 - /match Requests
  * #224 - /player Requests

*API Requests*
Alternatively, if the request is related to the way the API works we will
review the ticket and, if accepted, assign accordingly.

#### **Do you have questions about to use that Game Data Service?**

* Ask any question about how to use on the [Vainglory API Community Discord server](http://discord.me/vaingloryapi).

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:

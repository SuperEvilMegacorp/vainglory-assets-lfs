Q: I’ve never coded anything before and I have a sweet idea, how do I get started?

A: Head over to our public [Discord](https://discord.me/vaingloryapi). and chat with some of the developers and designers who are already building tools with the API. Many of them would be happy to help you get started on your project!

Q: When I signed up, it said I was enrolled in the Community free tier, what does that mean?

A: The API defaults to searching for matches over the last 3 hours. To find any matches before then, you must specify a Created-at time.

Q: Where can I find assets to use on my project?

A: We are working on a way to have assets available to you directly from Vainglory. In the meantime, the community has put together some great resources for you in [Discord](https://discord.me/vaingloryapi). You can find them in the pinned files in #vaingloryapi-chat.

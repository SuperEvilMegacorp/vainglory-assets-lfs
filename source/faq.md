### GETTING STARTED:  
<br>

######Q: What is an API?
A: API, Application Program Interface, is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. The Vainglory API allows you to get the data from your matches like Kills, Deaths, Assists and much more.

######Q: How do I use the API?
A: In order to use the API you must first get an API Key which will allow you to access the API information.

######Q: Where can I sign up for an API key?    
A: [Right here.](https://developer.vainglorygame.com)

######Q: I have my API Key. What do I do now? Where is the documentation?  
A: To get started, head over to the [Documentation](https://developer.vainglorygame.com/docs) where you can learn how to use the API. The Documentation is where there is a lot of details and examples provided of how to obtain the API data in multiple different languages.

######Q: When I signed up, it said I was enrolled in the Community free tier, what does that mean?  
A: The Community Free tier allows you to begin developing and testing your app/tool using real data. It comes with a default rate limit of 10 requests per minute and can be raised once your application is ready for production.

######Q: My dashboard says that my rate limit is 10 requests per minute. How can I request a higher rate limit?  
A: The default rate limit is for testing/development purposes only. Once you are ready to launch your tool, you can request a higher rate limit by emailing api@superevilmegacorp.com

######Q: How far along in development is the API?  
A: The API is currently in alpha. Alpha software can be unstable and could cause crashes or data loss. Alpha software may not contain all of the features that are planned for the final version.

######Q: I’ve never coded anything before and I have a sweet idea, how do I get started?  
A: Head over to our public [Discord](https://discord.me/vaingloryapi) and chat with some of the developers and designers who are already building tools with the API. Many of them would be happy to help you get started on your project!

######Q: Will you charge for use of the API?  
A: The API is free for non-commercial use.  For a commercial license, send an email to api@superevilmegacorp.com

######Q: If I have a question regarding the API, what do I do?  
A: Reach out to api@superevilmegacorp.com and jump into the [Discord](https://discord.me/vaingloryapi).  

### Development/Troubleshooting:  

######Q: The documentation is wrong. What do I do now?  
A: With the API still in Alpha, it’s very possible the docs are not completely up-to-date. We’re updating the docs as we go! You can also contribute to the docs on [Github](https://developer.vainglorygame.com) if you’d like to make some changes.

######Q: I just played a game but my stats haven’t showed up yet, what’s the deal? 
A: The API will recieve your latest matches approximately 1 hour after the time of your match. Information is processed and sent out every hour.

######Q: How do I find historical data from the API?
A: The API defaults to searching for matches over the last 3 hours. To find any matches before then, you must specify a Created-at time. The Vainglory API does not provide data before February 17, 2017.

######Q: Where can I find assets/images to use on my project?  
A: We are working on a way to have assets available to you directly from Vainglory. In the meantime, the community has put together some great resources for you in [Discord](https://discord.me/vaingloryapi). You can find them in the pinned files in #vaingloryapi-chat.

### API Challenge:  

######Q: How do I enter the API Challenge?  
A: You can sign up for the API Challenge [Right Here](https://developer.vainglorygame.com/rules).

######Q: If I have less than 4 team members on my team, what will happen?  
A: You can join the API Challenge with any team size up to four total. All prizes will be adjusted based on the number of members on your team (up to four).

######Q: What features will be available for the API Challenge?  
A: Some features available include Telemetry, Bulk Sample Data, Match Data and much more.

######Q:  Where do I sign up my team, or let you know I’m part of a team?  
A: For the API Challenge, you don’t need to tell us what team you’re on. When teams come into play is the submission portion of the challenge - when you submit your project, that’s when you’ll be asked who your team was!

######Q:  My team is making a mobile app.  Can we submit that?  
A:  YES! When submitting a mobile app, we just need to see that it works.  You can have it run on an emulator, Testflight, etc.  If you have specific questions on this reach us at api@superevilmegacorp.com  

### Beyond Alpha:

######Q:  What are some more features we can expect with the API?  
A:  We are constantly looking to add new features to the API.  In the future you can expect things like account linking, match reservations, and many more!  If you would like to help impact what the API will look like in the future, join the conversation on our public [Discord](discord.me/vaingloryapi) channel!
